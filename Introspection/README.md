## Why must we choose you?

I'm passionate about coding and I love to discuss my passion. I opted for biology in class 11 with the confidence of catching up to my Computer Science peers quickly. It is still a work in progress though.

I'm fairly proficient in Python and C++. I have a decent understanding of the concepts in general. My logical thinking is also high enough to understand most of what I learn quickly. Even if I don't, as I said, I love to discuss stuff like this. 
   
Most of all, I'm very interested in learning what I don't know, and my open mind and curiosity is what defines me as a good candidate. I truly hope to learn from my amFOSS seniors.
    
My other hobbies are Singing and I think I'm pretty good at that too; so if you need me to sing, I'll be there for you guysðŸ˜‚


## What is your plan for the next 6 months?

From what I see, I have less than a month to finish my amFOSS tasks. After I'm selected to join amFOSS, I plan to work more on open source coding. 

I chose to join the "Intro To Cyber Security And Ethical Hacking" workshop because I might not have a better chance to learn about this later. I plan on doing that by discussing with my roommates and friends who took the open source workshop.

I don't want to plan 6 months ahead in too much detail because I don't believe there won't be any setbacks. I would rather face what is thrown at me head-on. 


## How would you contribute back to the club? 

I'm not very familiar with how the club works, but as long as I can learn new stuff while competing with others I'm happy to contribute however I can. As a fresher the best way I can contribute is by improving my skills and being of much more help later.
I would like to be a part of some project in open source or whatever to improve my team skills and communication skills.
Of course, on the side, once I'm good enough, I hope to be like you guys who mentor freshers like me.


## Do you have any feedback on the selection process?

I already knew about the challenges I would face since I went through the tasks given to the 2019 batch. NGL they suck. The difficulty is high and I don't understand how you define the tasks as 'easy' and 'medium'. For a fresher without a coding background it is very difficult. But I do understand that you are looking for something in us that's not just knowing how to code well. So I'll be giving it my best.

I just finished all tasks except for the programming task. So I was able to develop a lot of skills. My googling ability went through the roof.
I now know how to search for the right answers. I also realised that finding the right resource can be a huge boost to my speed. I know how to debug for errors. I did a variety of stuff in the past month. 

In general, all were actually very simple. If I could go back in time and start over again, it wouldn't take me more than a few days of grounding. I'm not saying they were easy to finish. But the concept behind every task is simple. But the problem was that we didn't know what most of the tasks were about. So the new syntax and different methods were what threw us off. 

In all, the selection process seemed very fair. Most importantly I got to expand my knowledge.
