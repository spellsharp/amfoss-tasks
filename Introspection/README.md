##Why must we choose you?

    I'm passionate about coding and I love to discuss my passion. I opted for biology in class 11 with the confidence of catching up to my Computer Science peers quickly. It is still a work in progress though.     I'm fairly proficient in Python and C++. I have a decent understanding of the concepts in general. My logical thinking is also high enough to understand most of what I learn quickly. Even if I don't, as I said, I love to discuss stuff like this. 
    Most of all, I'm very interested in learning what I don't know, and my open mind and curiosity is what defines me as a good candidate. I truly hope to learn from my amFOSS seniors.
    My other hobbies are Singing and if I may, I'm pretty good at that too; so if you need me to sing, I'll also be there for you guys. 


##What is your plan for the next 6 months?
    From what I see, I have less than a month to finish my amFOSS tasks. After I'm selected to join you, I plan to work more on my open source coding. 
    I chose to join the "intro to cyber security and ethical hacking" workshop because I might not have a better chance to learn about this later. I plan on doing that by exchanging info with my roommates and friends who took the open source workshop.
    Next month I have my mid terms so my plan to learn new stuff might be delayed. 
    I don't want to plan 6 months ahead in too much detail because I don't believe there won't be any setbacks. I would rather face what is thrown at me head-on. 


##How would you contribute back to the club? 
    I'm not very familiar with how the club works, but as long as I can learn new stuff while competing with others I'm happy to contribute however I can. As a fresher the best way I can contribute is by improving my skills and hoping to be of much more help later. 
    Of course, once I'm at a satisfactory level, I hope to be like you guys who are willing teach freshers like me.


##Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
    I already knew about the challenges I would face since I went through the tasks given to the 2019 batch. NGL they suck. The difficulty is high and I don't understand how you define the tasks as 'easy' and 'medium'. For a fresher without a coding background it is very difficult. But I do understand that you are looking for something in us that's not just knowing how to code well. So I'll be giving it my best.
