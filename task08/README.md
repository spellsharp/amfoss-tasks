Helloo!
So I did some css and html before so learning to link css to html was easy.
The part that had me confused was the importing the sounds into my html. So for the first try I basically cut copy pasted all the mp3 files into the tasks08 folder where my index.html, styles.css and index.js were present. 
I had to go through some youtube videos to learn how to use the onclick for the button.

And then the problem was.... I didn't know how to type a javascript code from scratch. And at the current instance I'm having viral fever so I decided to take the shortcut of internal Javascript(I think that's what its called).
I went through another youtube video and learnt how to do the internal Javascript.

And I had a brief idea of how to change background color, text shadow and stuff. It was obvious enough looking at the code. 
For googlefonts I just followed ur instructions. 
Btw, I used Visual Studio Code for this.
