Here is the link that I referred to. This was a total confidence booster. I did this 2 days before submission so it feels good.
Now, time for the process:
I had googled as much as I can to find atleast an apparently goodlink I could use and lo and behold I get a nice little youtube video for making a basic addition, subtraction calculator. 

So my mind linked incrementor and decrementor to that. The problem I faced was that the video and resources are 4 years old. Some functions for example "NewCallBack" was changed to "FuncOf" and there were some other complications. 

But the video had another problem. It didn't have everything; in the sense that, it took input from the user, which I didn't want. 
So I just used my own value. Since Count was a global variable, it was very easy. For the reset function, I copied the format from my previous two functions. The reset function code was not difficult. 

And then the time came for me to move to my html. I copied the html from the site. God it was much better than simply adding code to the buttons you gave us. The reason for that was obviously the sense  of confidence. I managed to link the html to the backend(go).
Then after I checked that it worked on the console, I used the innerhtml thing to  put that onto my website's page (I'm sure you guys know what I'm talking about because I'm not really sure about that part yet, I'll refer some more to understand that)
It worked on the console, no reason to not work on the website. 


The task itself is very easy. But the lack of resource  materials, the new concept of Wasm, and poor understanding of the link between frontend and backend was what caused the most confusion. But the biggest reason was definitely the Golang; the syntax was totally new and the entire concept of linking my Go to html was just very intimidating. If I was told to do the entire thing again, it wouldn't take me more than an 30mins with the resources. 

umm.., if you are going to run this to check then localhost:8080 is what you need after downloading/cloning my repo. That's how it is in my server.go
Thanks.
