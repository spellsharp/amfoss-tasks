I familiarised myself with the linux commands for ubuntu terminal to a good extent. 
The ones I most commonly used were cd, mv, cp, rm, cat, nano, clear, ls.
cd was used to change directories, mv for moving and renaming, cp for copying(I used it only once and then I stopped using it), rm for removing/deleting a file, cat for concatenating and quick-viewing the contents of file, nano for editing a file if required, clear to clear the terminal page, ls to display the contents of the current local directory. 

The git commands however took a lot of effort. They were very difficult to figure out on my own so I took the help of god-knows-how-many websites. 
The ones I commonly used were:
git clone
git add .
git commit -m 
git remote add 
git config --global user.email "__________________"
git config --global user.name "___________________"
git push
git pull
git branch
git checkout



I used 'git clone' to clone the repositories. 
'git config --global' for configuring my github account to git(Terminal)
'git branch' and 'git branch -a' to check the branches and 'git checkout' to switch between branches as well as create branches.
'git add .' is used to make all the files in the current directory ready to commit. After committing, we use 'git push' to push the files from my local directory to my main branch if I remember right.
And then 'git pull' is for pulling whatever we push into the branch's repository. 

My Experience:
This task got on my nerves and the time I spent on it was one of the most annoying and stressful time ever. It is not because of the difficulty but the speed of the wifi. I just have to say this that we who tried this task using Amrita-Connect wifi have had to put down our laptops and try later too many times because of frustratingly slow wifi(so much time wasted, ughh). We kept getting errors because terminal didn't get properly configured with github account or something. Especially when trying to commit a file to the repository. 
Overall, the task itself seemed a lot of fun(like a treasure hunt) but I couldn't really enjoy it because of the poor wifi connection.
