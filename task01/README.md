I followed the instructions. The internet was slow so soemthings  went wrong a few times. But I did finish it. I guess I also got some experience in using the terminal
So... I added another screenshot on Nov 28 cuz I noticed a file in my device called script.py
After I opened it I saw it was about the starring task so I added that one as well.
