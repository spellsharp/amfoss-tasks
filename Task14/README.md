OverTheWire-Bandit was by far the easiest amFOSS task I have attempted till now. Its really cool. 

These were the ones I remember and had to refer a bit in google for:

ssh username@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
cd, ls
grep "^ *<input preceding stuff u want to find>", grep <>
uniq
sort
du -bh
echo
find . -size 1330c or 33c

Well, I'm sure I'm forgetting some of them. But the task was still quite fun anyway.
Thanks.
