This was one of the biggest challenges in my life. Mainly because of my lack of understanding of what the task actually wanted from me. I was bent on printing the correct output that I forgot about the csv file. That made me waste many many days with stuff like comfytable, prettytable, and stuff that I still don't understand at all. Then I found out that I didn't need to do all that. So I actually tried writing a pseudo-code (I made up necessary data). And with a bit of (tiny bit) of suggestion by my friend(I was desperate, I had spent way too many days on Rust), I figured out I had to use Lists. Or more like Vectors in Rust. After I got comfortable with the logic, I had to do it in rust... In Rust it didnt work because my mutable/immutable concept was weak. So I changed my Vectors to mutable and then pushed(appended) my data using for loops. The rust syntax was weird(like a mix of C/C++ and python).

The bigger part of the reason why this task was very difficult was my foolish decision of jumping from task to task. So it left me bits and pieces of everything I did and when I came back to the task, it was difficult to relate to it again. I had to go through what I had done fully and search the same links of references I used.
