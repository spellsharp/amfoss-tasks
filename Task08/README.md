I did a bit of html before I came to college, so I was familiar with most of the concepts. 
The linking of CSS to HTML was easy since I knew how to do it. But I am not familiar with JS so I didn't go through with the js code in the 
js file. I used the script tag and typed my js there. I had to refer to a website for adding sounds to my HTML. 

It was the simplest task for me even though it was not that easy.
