I did a bit of html before I came to college, so I was familiar with most of the concepts. 
The linking of CSS to HTML was easy since I knew how to do it. But I am not familiar with JS so I didn't go through with the js code in the 
js file. I used the script tag and typed my js there. I had to refer to a website for adding sounds to my HTML. 

Editing the styling(CSS) was very easy. I used google font for fonts, and the others like color, background color etc, were also easy to change.

It was the simplest task for me even though it was not that easy.
