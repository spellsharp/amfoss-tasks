Flutter was the most intimidating of all tasks. Afterall, it was quite similar to creating a game. And my approach to the problem at first was way off.
The installing itself was hard without help from my friends who attended amFOSS workshop.
Then, I started  watching flutter tutorials in youtube. That was a waste of time. And two days later, I started googling "Flame 2D  sprite movement with directions"; First link I got was: https://medium.com/flutter-community/create-2d-games-quickly-and-easily-with-flutter-flame-23ba66d0e0f3
It had everything except that it had an animation for the sprite instead of just a simple 'Update Position'. It took me only some time to find the right resource for the position of the bunny.
And then I just had to change my assets and some stuff in the code.
In this task the easy part was to find the code. The harder part was to completely understand what I did. 
But that was not that hard either. 

Personal Experience:
Didn't do much of the coding, as you already know. But I wasted many days just getting intimidated by the task(My assignments and tests had started and I had already been knee deep in some other tasks). And when I got to the coding part with the youtube tutorial, I found out the worst part about dart was the curly brackets. tsk.. annoying buggers. I just seemed to miss one of them and I couldn't find where. Also my yaml file was messed up so my entire code was red with errors all over. 

So lesson learnt(Note to self): Never juggle with tasks. Although if you finish you would be finishing tasks quickly back to back, and that's a cool feeling, the stress itself kills you.
