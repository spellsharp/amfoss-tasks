It was simple after I found a very good reference link. The C# was intimidating only because it had a different syntax. Everything else I could understand after I read the lines a few times. Everytime I got an error, I just looked at the line in which the error was there and tried fixing it on my own. If I couldn't do that, I just copied the error message and went to google baba. 
So yep. I liked this task quite a lot since it had very neat instructions and it felt good.
