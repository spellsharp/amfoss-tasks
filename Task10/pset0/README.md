This was my first time making anything with Scratch. It was actually a lot of fun. It took me two hours to experiment and fine tune the game that I created. 
I find the game amusing, the concept is as simple as it can get.

All you have to do is run away from a monster and survive as long as you can. If you can survive for 15 secs in the timer then you win.
The monster gets faster rapidly.
I know there is much room for improvement, but since this is my first time, I'm not really familiar with the available 'code'.
Survive!!
(If you don't really wanna play now, try it out later for sure)
