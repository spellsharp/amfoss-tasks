I took biology in my class 11, so the problems seemed quite intimidating. Then trying to solve them actually turned out to be very frustrating because I would not get it right for a very very long time. But when I did get it right, it was kinda satisfying. But most of the times, it was the Hackerrank website that was annoying. The code would work well in my IDE, but it would not in Hackerrank properly. Well it was a very new experience for me.
